# smartthings-api-smartapp

A simple (?) SmartThings SmartApp, based on the Web Services Smart App Tutorial found here:
http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/smartapp-web-services-developers-guide/tutorial-part1.html

Goal is to modify the sample to extend to / include the PowerMeter and EnergyMeter capabilities in several SmartThings-compatible devices, including the AeoTec Smart Switch 6.
